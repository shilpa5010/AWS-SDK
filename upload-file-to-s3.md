example with javascript in aws sdk

### Prerequisites
    Node.js installed: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
    AWS account: You need an AWS account with S3 permissions.
    AWS credentials: Configure your AWS credentials using the AWS CLI or by creating a ~/.aws/credentials file.Installation

First, create a new directory for your project and install the AWS SDK for JavaScript:
mkdir my-s3-app
cd my-s3-app
npm init -y
npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3

Example Code
Hereâ€™s a simple script that uploads a file to an S3 bucket:
// Import the necessary AWS SDK clients and commands
const { S3Client, PutObjectCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-s3");
const fs = require("fs");
const path = require("path");

// Create an S3 client
const s3Client = new S3Client({ region: "us-west-2" }); // Change region as needed

// Define the parameters for the upload
const bucketName = "your-bucket-name"; // Replace with your bucket name
const fileName = "example.txt"; // Replace with your file name
const filePath = path.join(__dirname, fileName); // Path to the file

const uploadFile = async () => {
  try {
    // Read the file content
    const fileContent = fs.readFileSync(filePath);

    // Set up the upload parameters
    const uploadParams = {
      Bucket: bucketName,
      Key: fileName,
      Body: fileContent,
    };

    // Upload the file
    const data = await s3Client.send(new PutObjectCommand(uploadParams));
    console.log("File uploaded successfully. Location:", data.Location);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error uploading file:", error);
  }
};

// Call the upload function
uploadFile();

Running the Script

    Make sure you replace your-bucket-name with the name of your S3 bucket and create a file named example.txt in the same directory as your script.
    Run the script:
    node your-script-file.js
Summary
This script initializes an S3 client, reads a file from the local filesystem, and uploads it to an S3 bucket. Be sure to handle AWS permissions and bucket policies to allow uploads. You can expand this example to include more features like error handling, listing files, or deleting objects from the bucket.
